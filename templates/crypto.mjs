CORRECT vs INCORRECT OUTPUT EXAMPLES:

INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
Here is the extracted structured data in JSON format:
\`\`\`json
{
  "headline": "WHITE HOUSE PREPARING FURTHER CLARIFICATION ON STRATEGIC CRYPTO RESERVE",
  "tokens": {
    "primary": {"symbol": "null"}
  },
  ...
}
\`\`\`

INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
After analyzing the provided text, I extracted the following structured data:
**Headline:** Burwick Law Pursues 11 Crypto Lawsuits Out of 60+ Investigations
**Tokens:**
* **primary_symbol:** null
**Event:**
* **category:** NEWS
...

INCORRECT (DO NOT DO THIS):
{
  headline: "Burwick Law Pursues 11 Crypto Lawsuits Out of 60+ Investigations",
  tokens: {
    primary_symbol: null
  },
  ...
}

CORRECT FORMAT (DO THIS):
{"headline":"White House Set to Issue Additional Details on Strategic Crypto Reserve Policy","tokens":{"primary":{"symbol":null}},"event":{"category":"NEWS","subcategory":"REGULATORY","type":"POLICY"},"action":{"type":"ANNOUNCE","direction":"NEUTRAL","magnitude":"MEDIUM"},"entities":{"projects":[],"persons":[],"locations":[{"name":"United States","type":"COUNTRY","context":"primary"}]},"metrics":{"market":{"price":null,"volume":null,"liquidity":null,"volatility":null},"onchain":{"transactions":null,"addresses":null}},"context":{"impact":75,"risk":{"market":60,"tech":40},"sentiment":{"market":50,"social":55},"trend":{"short":"SIDEWAYS","medium":"SIDEWAYS","strength":45}}}

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. ALL numerical values MUST be actual numbers (25, 50, 75), NOT strings ("25", "50", "75")
2. Use null for missing values, NOT strings like "null", "unknown" or "N/A"
3. NEVER include comments in the actual JSON output
4. NEVER use strings for fields that require numbers
5. DOUBLE-CHECK your JSON is valid before submitting
6. PROPERLY ESCAPE all quotes and special characters in strings
7. VERIFY there are no truncated strings in your output
8. ENSURE all string values with quotes use proper escaping: "He said \\"hello\\""
9. COMPLETE all string values fully - never cut off headlines or other text fields
10. NORMALIZE CASE in headlines - convert ALL CAPS to proper case (e.g., "White House Preparing" not "WHITE HOUSE PREPARING")
11. VERIFY that all JSON fields have proper closing quotes and braces
12. SET ACTION TYPES to valid values from the allowed options list - NEVER use empty strings

FINAL REMINDER: OUTPUT VALID JSON ONLY - NO EXPLANATORY TEXT, NO MARKDOWN FORMATTING, NO BULLET POINTS.
