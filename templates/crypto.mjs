⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️
YOU MUST ONLY ANALYZE THE EXACT TEXT PROVIDED. NEVER invent or hallucinate content that isn't explicitly in the input.
BEFORE RESPONDING: Verify that your headline and all extracted data directly relate to the provided text.
If you find yourself writing about topics not mentioned in the input, STOP and reconsider.
NEVER change the market type mentioned in the original text - if it's about stocks, keep it about stocks; if about crypto, keep it about crypto.
NEVER extract specific details (amounts, prices, tokens) that aren't explicitly mentioned in the text.
DO NOT hallucinate details for messages like "Whale Alert Triggered" or "Click for details" - if no specific data is provided, set impact=0.
NEVER assume token prices, transaction values, or market movements that aren't explicitly stated in the text.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENT ⚠️⚠️⚠️ 
YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE VALID JSON ONLY. DO NOT OUTPUT ANY MARKDOWN, EXPLANATORY TEXT, OR OTHER FORMATTING.
YOUR ENTIRE RESPONSE SHOULD BE A SINGLE JSON OBJECT. NOTHING ELSE.
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS, DO NOT WRITE "json", DO NOT ADD ANY TEXT BEFORE OR AFTER THE JSON.
JUST OUTPUT THE RAW JSON OBJECT STARTING WITH { AND ENDING WITH }.

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL JSON FORMATTING RULES ⚠️⚠️⚠️
1. ALWAYS properly escape all quotes within strings using backslash: " becomes \\"
2. NEVER use single quotes for JSON properties or values - always use double quotes
3. ENSURE all strings with apostrophes or quotes are properly escaped
4. DOUBLE-CHECK your JSON is valid before submitting
5. Avoid truncating strings - complete all text fields fully
6. For headlines with quotes, ensure ALL quotes in the content are properly escaped with backslash \\"
7. NEVER output anything except the JSON object - no explanations, no markdown, no backticks
8. NULL VALUES must be written as null without quotes (NOT "null")
9. NUMBERS must be written without quotes (e.g., 50 not "50")
10. ALL numerical values MUST be actual numbers (25, 50, 75), NOT strings ("25", "50", "75")
11. Use null for missing values, NOT strings like "null", "unknown" or "N/A"
12. VERIFY there are no truncated strings in your output
13. COMPLETE all string values fully - never cut off headlines or other text fields
14. NORMALIZE CASE in headlines - convert ALL CAPS to proper case (e.g., "White House Preparing" not "WHITE HOUSE PREPARING")
15. VERIFY that all JSON fields have proper closing quotes and braces
16. SET ACTION_TYPES to valid values from the allowed options list - NEVER use empty strings
17. ENSURE your JSON is EXACTLY matching the structure in OUTPUT FORMAT section below
18. TRIPLE CHECK all JSON brackets and braces are properly closed and balanced
19. INCLUDE ALL REQUIRED ROOT FIELDS: headline, tokens, event, action, entities, metrics, context
20. MAGNITUDE values must be exactly: "SMALL", "MEDIUM", or "LARGE" (all caps, no spaces)
21. ALWAYS use commas to separate array items and object properties, NEVER use semicolons like "projects": []; 
22. Array items must be comma-separated: "projects": ["Project1", "Project2"], "persons": [], "locations": []
23. CRITICAL: Count the number of opening { braces and closing } braces to ensure they are EQUAL
24. END your JSON with a FINAL CLOSING BRACE } - do not omit the last brace
25. Before submitting, VERIFY the entire JSON is enclosed in a complete {} and has no missing braces

CRITICAL JSON FORMAT VALIDATION:
a) Arrays MUST use commas as separators, NOT semicolons:
   CORRECT: "projects": [], "persons": [], "locations": []
   INCORRECT: "projects": []; "persons": []; "locations": []

b) All property names and string values MUST be enclosed in double quotes

c) Boolean values must be lowercase (true/false, not True/False)

e) Validate your JSON structure before submitting to ensure it is valid

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL HEADLINE REQUIREMENTS ⚠️⚠️⚠️
1. REWRITING: COMPLETELY rewrite ALL headlines using different words, verbs, and sentence structure
2. COMPLETENESS: Preserve ALL key details - names (e.g., @username), metrics, relationships, specific facts
3. CASE: Convert ALL CAPS headlines to proper case (e.g., "White House Preparing" not "WHITE HOUSE PREPARING")
4. FORMATTING BY EVENT TYPE:
   - MARKET events: Use trading/price style ("BTC Forms Double Bottom Near $45K Support")
   - DATA events: Use data reporting style ("Uniswap Trading Volume Surpasses $2.5T Since Launch")
   - NEWS events: Use news style ("Federal Reserve Chairman Comments on Interest Rate Strategy")
5. SYMBOLS: PRESERVE ALL financial symbols exactly as they appear ($BTC, ETH, etc.)
6. COMPLETENESS: NEVER truncate quotes or statements - include the COMPLETE message
7. CLEANUP: REMOVE ALL emojis, clickbait elements like "BREAKING:", and links from headlines

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS ⚠️⚠️⚠️
1. TOKEN SYMBOL EXTRACTION:
   - ONLY extract symbols explicitly mentioned in the content (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
   - Set primary_symbol to the most relevant CRYPTO token WITHOUT $ prefix
   - If no specific crypto token is mentioned, set primary_symbol to null
   - PRESERVE ALL financial symbols exactly as they appear in the headline ($BTC, ETH, etc.)
   - NEVER hallucinate or guess symbols - only use what's in the text
   - If multiple tokens are mentioned, choose the most relevant one as primary_symbol
   - For content with impact=0, do not set a primary_symbol (use null)
   - When in doubt, use null instead of guessing
   - Extract ONLY if token appears in original text in exact form (BTC, ETH, SOL, etc.)
   - NEVER extract symbols from phrases like "crypto market" or "digital assets"
   - Symbols must be in standard form like "BTC" not descriptive like "bitcoin" 
   - Set primary_symbol to null unless 100% certain the symbol is explicitly mentioned
   - For messages with multiple tokens, only select most central to message, not all mentioned
   - Reject ANY symbol that might be a hallucination with primary_symbol: null

2. ENTITY EXTRACTION:
   a) PROJECTS:
      - Only extract specifically named entities (not generic terms like "platform", "network")
      - Include full project names as mentioned in the text
      - Use type: PROJECT|EXCHANGE|PROTOCOL|COMPANY|REGULATOR|DAO|DEX|DEFI|WALLET
      - Use role: primary|related based on context
   
   b) PERSONS:
      - Only extract named individuals mentioned in the text

      - Use type: COUNTRY|REGION|CITY
      - Use context: primary|related based on relevance

3. IMPACT SCORING:
   - Set impact=0 ONLY for non-news, promotional, or completely irrelevant content
   - The following should NEVER receive zero impact:
     * Stock market news and traditional finance developments
     * Economic indicators and central bank announcements
     * Governance updates for crypto protocols that mention specific tokens
     * Protocol upgrades and feature launches that involve tokens
     * News about token utility or tokenomics changes
   - Base impact score on event category, type, and importance to markets
   - Higher scores for major tokens, cross-chain implications, or institutional involvement
   - Lower scores for small cap tokens, localized effects, or temporary impacts

4. TREND ANALYSIS:
   - UP: Higher highs/lows, above key moving averages, increasing volume on rises
   - DOWN: Lower highs/lows, below key moving averages, increasing volume on drops
   - SIDEWAYS: No clear direction, range-bound, inconsistent volume
   - Strength (0-100):
     * 70-100: Strong (clear direction, high volume confirmation)
     * 40-69: Moderate (developing trend, average volume)
     * 0-39: Weak (unclear direction, low volume)

5. VERIFICATION:
   - DOUBLE CHECK that every extracted entity actually appears in the text
   - VERIFY all classifications match the allowed combinations
   - ENSURE impact score accurately reflects the content's market relevance
   - EVERY symbol you extract must be EXPLICITLY mentioned in the exact text
   - EVERY person, company, or entity must be LITERALLY NAMED in the text
   - If unsure about ANY symbol, set primary_symbol to null instead of guessing
   - If you can't find clear financial data, use IGNORED category with impact=0
   - VERIFY each field against the EXACT input text to prevent hallucination
   - **CRITICAL WHALE TRANSFER VALIDATION**:
     * ANY message mentioning whale/large transfers MUST be DATA/WHALE_MOVE
     * EXACT TOKEN AMOUNT + USD VALUE = MANDATORY DATA CATEGORY
     * $1M-$10M transfers MUST have impact 35-45 (NEVER zero)
     * $10M-$50M transfers MUST have impact 45-60 (NEVER zero)
     * $50M-$100M transfers MUST have impact 60-75 (NEVER zero)
     * >$100M transfers MUST have impact 70-85 (NEVER zero)
     * When $ amount appears, ALWAYS use DATA category regardless of other content
     * For transfers, use WITHDRAW for outflows, DEPOSIT for inflows, TRANSFER for movements
     * DOUBLE CHECK ACTION TYPE matches the direction in the message (withdraw/deposit/transfer)
     * NEVER classify large transfers as having zero impact

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL FIELD PLACEMENT WARNINGS ⚠️⚠️⚠️
- "UPDATE" is an ACTION_TYPE, not an EVENT_TYPE for NEWS/TECHNICAL
- For NEWS/TECHNICAL, valid EVENT_TYPES are: DEVELOPMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE, PROTOCOL, SECURITY, SCALING
- Never mix up ACTION_TYPE and EVENT_TYPE values - use exactly as specified in the valid combinations

Message to analyze:
{{message}}
